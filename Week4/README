The dangers of dict.get!!!

Both the scc.py and scc2.py file find the strongly connected components in a graph.

In fact they are almost identical, with the exception of adding node to an SCC group.

scc2.py uses a dict.get(key,[]) to either obtain the dict-value for that key, or return an
empty list if the dict doesn't have that key.

scc.py uses a defaultdict(list) so I don't need to worry if the key exists yet.


scc2.py has a runtime of hours on the graph contained in SCC.txt

scc.py has a runtime of 1-3 minutes.

WOW!
